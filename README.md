## Usage

```
Usage: wden [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -p, --profile <PROFILE>  Sets the profile that will be used. Profile names can only include lowercase alphanumeric characters, dashes (-) and underscores (_) [default: default]
      --list-profiles      Instead of starting the application, list all stored profiles
  -h, --help               Print help (see more with '--help')
  -V, --version            Print version

Server options:
      --bitwarden-cloud-region <BITWARDEN_CLOUD_REGION>
          Sets the current profile to use the given Bitwarden cloud server region [possible values: us, eu]
  -s, --server-url <SERVER_URL>
          Sets the current profile to use the given server url (single host)
      --api-server-url <API_SERVER_URL>
          Sets the current profile to use the given API server url. This needs to be set with --identity-server-url
      --identity-server-url <IDENTITY_SERVER_URL>
          Sets the current profile to use the given identity server url. This needs to be set with --api-server-url

Advanced options:
      --accept-invalid-certs  Accept invalid and untrusted (e.g. self-signed) certificates when connecting to the server. This option makes connections insecure, so avoid using it
```

### With Bitwarden Cloud

Just run the wden binary.
```
./wden
```

Wden will create a new profile (named `default`), with the Bitwarden Cloud US region configured as the server.

To use the EU region, launch wden with the `--bitwarden-cloud-region eu` option.

### With a self-hosted Bitwarden-compatible server

Run the wden binary, and set the server URL with the `-s` flag. The flag has to be passed only on the first launch, because wden will store the server URL in the configuration.

```
./wden -s https://my-own-bitwarden.example.com
```

Wden will create a new profile (named `default`) with the given server URL.

### With multiple profiles

Multiple profiles with different settings can be used when connecting to multiple Bitwarden instances or with multiple users. For example, this allows quickly accessing a personal and a work Bitwarden vault. Wden will remember configuration values (server URL, lock timeout, ...), login email addresses and two-factor logins separately for each profile.

When launching wden, specify the profile name with the `-p` flag. The name may only include lowercase characters (`a-z`), digits, dashes and underscores. The server URL may be set with the `-s` flag on the first launch, but it's not necessary on subsequent launches.

```
./wden -p personal -s https://my-own-bitwarden.example.com
```

All existing profiles can be listed with the `--list-profiles` parameter.

### Configuration files

Configuration files, one for each profile, are stored under the user's config directory (by default, `~/.config/wden` on Linux and `%appdata%\wden` on Windows).


### Bypassing CAPTCHA requirement

Bitwarden cloud and self-hosted Bitwarden-compatible servers may require CAPTCHA verification upon login in some situations. Because wden cannot display the CAPTCHA challenge in the terminal, Personal API keys generated in the Bitwarden web vault can be used to skip the CAPTCHA requirement.

1. When CAPTCHA is required, wden notices this and displays an additional text field in the login dialog.
2. Go to Account Settings in your Bitwarden web vault. Navigate to Security â†’ Keys.
3. View your API key.
4. Copy the `client_secret` value to the Personal API key field in the login dialog.

CAPTCHA verification should not be required again on the same wden profile after it has been completed once.
