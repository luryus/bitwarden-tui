## Usage

```
./wden --help
wden 

USAGE:
    wden [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS:
    -h, --help                       Print help information
        --list-profiles              Instead of starting the application, list all stored profiles
    -p, --profile <PROFILE>          Sets the profile that will be used. Profile names can only
                                     include lowercase alphanumeric characters, dashes (-) and
                                     underscores (_) [default: default]
    -s, --server-url <SERVER_URL>    Sets the Bitwarden server url. If not set, the url stored in
                                     the profile will be used. If a new profile is created without a
                                     server url set, https://vault.bitwarden.com will be used
```

### With Bitwarden Cloud

Just run the wden binary.
```
./wden
```

Wden will create a new profile (named `default`), with the Bitwarden Cloud configured as the server.

### With a self-hosted Bitwarden-compatible server

Run the wden binary, and set the server URL with the `-s` flag. The flag has to be passed only on the first launch, because wden will store the server URL in the configuration.

```
./wden -s https://my-own-bitwarden.example.com
```

Wden will create a new profile (named `default`) with the given server URL.

### With multiple profiles

Multiple profiles with different settings can be used when connecting to multiple Bitwarden instances or with multiple users. For example, this allows quickly accessing a personal and a work Bitwarden vault. Wden will remember configuration values (server URL, lock timeout, ...), login email addresses and two-factor logins separately for each profile.

When launching wden, specify the profile name with the `-p` flag. The name may only include lowercase characters (`a-z`), digits, dashes and underscores. The server URL may be set with the `-s` flag on the first launch, but it's not necessary on subsequent launches.

```
./wden -p personal -s https://my-own-bitwarden.example.com
```

All existing profiles can be listed with the `--list-profiles` parameter.

### Configuration files

Configuration files, one for each profile, are stored under the user's config directory (by default, `~/.config/wden` on Linux and `%appdata%\wden` on Windows).


### Bypassing CAPTCHA requirement

Bitwarden Cloud and self-hosted Bitwarden-compatible servers may require CAPTCHA verification upon login in some situations. Because wden cannot display the CAPTCHA challenge in the terminal, Bitwarden's personal API keys can be used to skip the CAPTCHA requirement.

1. When CAPTCHA is required, wden notices this and displays an additional text field in the login dialog.
2. Go to Account Settings in your Bitwarden vault. Navigate to Security â†’ Keys.
3. View your API key.
4. Copy the `client_secret` value to the Personal API key field in the login dialog.

Bitwarden should not require the CAPTCHA verification again on the same wden profile after it has been completed once.
